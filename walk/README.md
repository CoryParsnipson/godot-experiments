# walk

This is a demo for mobile to try to count user steps for a game that will use step counter as a game element.

## setup

This project is made with Godot Engine 4.2.2 (64bit on Windows).

On my decade old windows 10 laptop, it may throw up an "unable to initialize vulkan drivers" error. You can work around this by starting the engine with the `--rendering-driver opengl3` argument. For convenience, I've modified my godot shortcut to have this flag set automatically.

    * Right click on the shortcut icon and then click "Properties".
    * Under the "Shortcut" tab, look for the value next to "Target".
    * It should say something like "C:\Program Files\Godot Engine\Godot_v4.2.2-stable_win64.exe"
    * *Outside of the quotes* add the `--rendering-driver opengl3` flag, so:
      `"C:\Program Files\<etc>\Godot_v4.2.2-stable_win64.exe" --rendering-driver opengl3`

## Android plugin

TBD
